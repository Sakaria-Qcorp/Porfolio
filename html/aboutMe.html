<p class="border-left"> 

    My name is Sakaria Ahmed and I started coding in 2013 as a hobby of mine.<br> 
    The first language I started on my journey towards computer programming was C#.<br>
    I studied C# from Microsoft's website tutorials and learned the fundimentals from that platform. <br>
    I'm currently enrolled in the Universaty of Minnesota's coding boot camp for front and back end website development. <br>
    As a young man at my high point I spoke three languages. The languages were English, Kiswahili, and Somali.<br>
     I've never had issue picking up new languages and Im very quick learner.
